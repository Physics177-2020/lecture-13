    "The name has two parts: a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) is a stochastic model that undergoes transitions between different configurations, with the key condition that the probability of any event/transition depends only on the current configuration of the system. And, as you've seen before, [Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) methods are ones that make use of random sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "MCMC works by constructing a stochastic model -- a Markov chain -- whose stationary distribution is the same as the one that we want to sample from. Monte Carlo simulations of the Markov chain then provide us with samples from the desired distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Markov chain is defined by a set of transition probabilities $T_{ij}$ between configurations labeled $i$ and $j$. We can ensure that the stationary distribution of the Markov chain is the same as the one that we want to sample by enforcing the [detailed balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detailed_balance) condition\n",

This is an easy case where we can check our answer analytically. First, let's confirm the analytical result when the interaction energy $\\epsilon = 1$ and the temperature $T=1$."
